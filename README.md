This library is a fork from [cespare/mph](https://github.com/cespare/mph).

mph is a Go package for that implements a [minimal perfect hash table][mph] over
strings. It uses the ["Hash, displace, and compress" algorithm][algo]  and the
[Murmur3 hash function][murmur3].

Some quick benchmark results (this is on an i7-8700K):

* `Build` constructs a minimal perfect hash table from a 102k word dictionary in
  18ms (construction time is linear in the size of the input).
* `Lookup`s on that dictionary take about 30ns and are 27% faster than a
  `map[string]uint32`:

      BenchmarkTableMap-12            145449822               40.92 ns/op
